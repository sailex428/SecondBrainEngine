A serverside Minecraft pathfinder bot, based on Baritone.

**Warning: this project is experimental. Although it is already performing well in vanilla, strange bugs may arise in heavily modded environments.
Backwards compatibility is also not being considered at the current time, so avoid depending on this for stable projects.**

There's a [showcase video](https://youtu.be/CZkLXWo4Fg4) made by @Adovin#0730 on Baritone. [Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StquF69-_wI) a (very old!) video leijurv made showing off what it can do. [Tutorial playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnwnJ1qsS7CoQl9Si-RTluuzCo_4Oulpa)

To install Automatone as a user, install the Fabric loader and drop the latest jar from [releases](https://github.com/Ladysnake/Automatone/releases).
For more information, see [Installation & setup](SETUP.md). Once Automatone is installed, look [here](USAGE.md) for instructions on how to use it.

This project is based on Baritone, which is itself an updated version of MineBot,
the original version of the bot for Minecraft 1.8.9, rebuilt for 1.12.2 through 1.16.5.
Automatone/Baritone focuses on reliability and particularly performance (it's over [30x faster](https://github.com/cabaletta/baritone/pull/180#issuecomment-423822928) than MineBot at calculating paths).

## Getting Started

Here are some links to help to get started (sending you to Baritone documentation for now):

- [Features](FEATURES.md)

- [Installation & setup](SETUP.md)

- [API Javadocs](https://baritone.leijurv.com/)

- [Settings](https://baritone.leijurv.com/baritone/api/Settings.html#field.detail)

- [Usage (chat control)](USAGE.md)

## API

The API is heavily documented. The Javadocs for Automatone itself are not currently hosted anywhere, but you can find
the (possibly inadequate) Javadocs for the latest release of Baritone [here](https://baritone.leijurv.com/).
Please note that usage of anything located outside of the ``baritone.api`` package is not supported by the API release
jar.

Below is an example of basic usage for changing some settings, and then pathing to an X/Z goal.

```java
IBaritone baritone = BaritoneAPI.getProvider().getBaritone(entity);
baritone.settings().allowSprint.set(true);
baritone.settings().primaryTimeoutMS.set(2000L);

baritone.getCustomGoalProcess().setGoalAndPath(new GoalXZ(10000, 20000));
```

### Control a NPC Player
This mod includes fabric-carpet. To spawn a NPC use the `/player <your-npc-name> spawn`.
Then you can execute every automatone command as the NPC player. 
Example: `/execute as <your-npc-name> run automatone goto 100 100`

## FAQ

### Can I use Automatone to cheat?
Good luck, as of now it is completely unable to control real players.

### How is it so fast?

Magic. (Hours of [leijurv](https://github.com/leijurv/) enduring excruciating pain)
